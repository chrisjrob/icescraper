Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for an icescraper

Status
------
Work in Progress.

As yet I have not printed this design. There is nothing particularly tricky about it, it should print easily; although it may use a fair amount of filament.

PLA may be too brittle for this application, you may be better off with ABS.

Instructions
------------

 - Edit SCAD file to your configuration
 - Slice
 - Print

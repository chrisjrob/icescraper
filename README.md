Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for an icescraper

Fully parametric, but currently set to 10cm width with a 10cm handle.

Now has pointy scourers on the top lip of the scoop, for an easy first scrape.

Status
------
Work in Progress.

As yet I have not printed this design. There is nothing particularly tricky about it, it should print easily; although it may use a fair amount of filament.

PLA may be too brittle for this application, you may be better off with ABS.

Instructions
------------
If you want to edit the dimensions, then you will need to install the [MCAD library](https://github.com/elmom/MCAD), edit the .scad file and compile and re-export the STL.

With either the attached STL, or your newly exported STL, then generate gcodes and send to printer in the usual way.

* Install the [MCAD library](https://github.com/elmom/MCAD "MCAD on GitHub")
* Edit SCAD file to your configuration
* Slice
* Print
